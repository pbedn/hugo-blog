#### Ernest Cline - Ready Player One (February 2021)

Genre: science fiction
Plot: young cyber padawan on a road to get princess and half of the kingdom (actually quarter)

Beginning a little boring, middle ok, ending better. Sometimes annoying and trivial, and how the heck the main hero just knows everything, and plays the guitar like a god.
In general I enjoyed it, but I am not going to read second part - Ready Player Two and author's other book - Armada. too much of 80s in the first part for me ;)
As for the rating, I am giving three eggs out of five.

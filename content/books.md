#### Naval - “Surviving Belize”, “You Snooze, You Lose”, “The Gulf” and “Camp Pozzi” (March 2021)

Genre: biography, history
Plot: a story of GROM soldier from recruitment, boot camp, training, military actions, deployments to Iraq

I read, actually listened to, four books by Naval about his military adventures. And as for someone who was dreaming when young, about being a 'commando', these stories were interesting and inspiring. Books are short but immersive. Real action from a real soldier. And as a funny note, Naval was consulting on "Medal of Honor. Warfighter" game, which was very good as well (solid linear military fps).

#### Kafir - “Contact. Polish intelligence forces in Afghanistan” (March 2021)

Genre - biography, history
Plot: polish intelligence officer serving 1 year in Afghanistan during "stabilization mission"

Honest and sometimes brutal truth about so-called stabilization mission, and war in reality. The author shows the life inside the military base and interactions with local people. During his deployment, he was involved in a few dangerous, life-threatening missions. In between that stories he does a good job analysing the geopolitical situation and criticise the way things are done. Interesting note - people in Afghanistan have another way of thinking (in terms of tribal, family and social laws they are still hundreds of years in the past), so trying to force them modern democracy is just not working as expected.

#### Ernest Cline - "Ready Player One" (February 2021)

Genre: science fiction
Plot: young cyber padawan on a road to get princess and half of the kingdom (actually quarter)

Beginning a little boring, middle ok, ending better. Sometimes annoying and trivial, and how the heck the main hero just knows everything, and plays the guitar like a god.
In general I enjoyed it, but I am not going to read second part - Ready Player Two and author's other book - Armada. too much of 80s in the first part for me ;)
As for the rating, I am giving three eggs out of five.

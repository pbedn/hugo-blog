#### Matthew Van Natta - "The Beginner's Guide to Stoicism: Tools for Emotional Resilience and Positivity" (May 2021)

> Philosophy
* a lot of small pieces of advice from ancient stoic teachers packed in brief

This was my first look into stoicism and I would say, the topic is worth researching. But I guess less wisdom at the beginning is better as one can easily get lost and overwhelmed. And this little book was that and needs rereading or looking somewhere else.
Rating: three stoic beards out of five.

#### Tim Tamashiro - "How to Ikigai: Lessons for Finding Happiness and Living Your Life's Purpose" (April 2021)

> Self Help, Philosophy
* Tim personal story and few other people in the context of Ikigai.

Ikigai is life's purpose. In general, one should do:
1) what you love
2) what the world needs
3) what you are paid for
4) what you are great at

#### Héctor García, Francesc Miralles - "Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life" (April 2021)

> Self Help, Health, Philosophy
* short story about Okinawa elders and few general tips on wellbeing

I like the concept of Ikigai, but in this book, though "it started it all", Ikigai is barely mentioned. Most focus put on general tips. I read already other books about self-help, so nothing new. One thing to remember, if you like to live long then grow vegetables in your garden. 100 years of living guaranteed.

#### Naval - “Surviving Belize”, “You Snooze, You Lose”, “The Gulf” and “Camp Pozzi” (March 2021)

> biography
* a story of GROM soldier from recruitment, boot camp, training, military actions, deployments to Iraq

I read, actually listened to, four books by Naval about his military adventures. And as for someone who was dreaming when young, about being a 'commando', these stories were interesting and inspiring. Books are short but immersive. Real action from a real soldier. And as a funny note, Naval was consulting on "Medal of Honor. Warfighter" game, which was very good as well (solid linear military fps).

#### Kafir - “Contact. Polish intelligence forces in Afghanistan” (March 2021)

> biography
* polish intelligence officer serving 1 year in Afghanistan during "stabilization mission"

Honest and sometimes brutal truth about so-called stabilization mission, and war in reality. The author shows the life inside the military base and interactions with local people. During his deployment, he was involved in a few dangerous, life-threatening missions. In between that stories he does a good job analysing the geopolitical situation and criticise the way things are done. Interesting note - people in Afghanistan have another way of thinking (in terms of tribal, family and social laws they are still hundreds of years in the past), so trying to force them modern democracy is just not working as expected.

#### Ernest Cline - "Ready Player One" (February 2021)

> science fiction
* young cyber padawan on a road to get princess and half of the kingdom (actually quarter)

Beginning a little boring, middle ok, ending better. Sometimes annoying and trivial, and how the heck the main hero just knows everything, and plays the guitar like a god.
In general I enjoyed it, but I am not going to read second part - Ready Player Two and author's other book - Armada. too much of 80s in the first part for me ;)
As for the rating, I am giving three eggs out of five.

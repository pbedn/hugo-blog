Hi, I am Pawel. In my 9-5 I work for transportation startup as a Python programmer, where I write tools for converting schedule files and build internal web app for data team in Flask.

Here on this blog I want to share some of the problems I encounter on my journey to being better developer.

In the free time I enjoy training Capoeira, dancing Forro and playing the guitar.

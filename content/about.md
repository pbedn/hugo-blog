Hi my name is Pawel. I work currently for technology startup as a Python programmer. I do mostly scripting (dealing with lots of transportation schedule files), managing internal web app in Flask and writing tests. 

Here on this blog I want to share some of the problems I encounter on my journey to being better developer.

You can read something more about my work experience on linkedln.

In the free time I enjoy training Capoeira, dancing Forro and playing the guitar.

I like to call myself a Sci-Fi Engineer, because of my technical background and love for science fiction.

I am lucky to get paid for doing things I enjoy. My favourite programming language is Python, but I do not close myself using only one tool.

In free time I like to train Capoeira, dance Forro or play the Blues on my Squier Classic Vibe '50s Stratocater :)

I like to call myself a Sci-Fi Engineer, because of my technical background and love for everything science fiction.

I am self-taught programmer, coming from petroleum engineering background. I started with Python programming language and it is still my favourite. However my view is more pragmatic at the moment as I touched a few other languages during work (PHP, JavaScript) or side projects (Go, C#). I realise now that language is just one piece of puzzle, where the fun (or struggle) only begins ;)

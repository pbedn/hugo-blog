I am writing these notes when I find something worth documenting. It is not personal blog, but mostly technical related things I write in my free time.

All posts sources are on [Github][Github], if you have found some errors, please create an issue there. Thanks.

For questions and comments, my email is *pbedn at outlook.com*.

You can read something about me at [Linkedin profile][linkedin], or meet in person at Pykonik meeting (Krakow Python user group).

I like to call myself a Sci-Fi Engineer, because of my technical background and love for science fiction (books, games).

I am lucky to get paid for doing things I enjoy. My favourite programming language is Python, but I work with JavaScript too and would like to explore Go in near future.

In free time, when I do not solve next puzzle from [Checkio][checkio], I train Capoeira, dance Forro or play the Blues on my Squier Classic Vibe '50s Stratocater :)

I like to call myself a Sci-Fi Engineer, because of my technical background and love for science fiction.

I am lucky to get paid for doing things I enjoy. Currently I am building automation system for managing bus and trains timetables using my favourite programming language - Python.

In free time I like to train Capoeira, dance Forro or play the Blues on my Squier Classic Vibe '50s Stratocater :)
